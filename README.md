# Self-hosted Cookbook

If you're like me and love not only to self-host, but to constantly test new apps, you probably already discovered `docker-compose` as the fastest and easiest way towards that goal.
There is, however, one problem: not all image authors are as great as [linuxserver.io](https://hub.docker.com/u/linuxserver), whose docs are as simple as they should be: you just copy & paste `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d` and IT JUST WORKS!
This is how all images should be documented!
But unfortunately, it isn't!<br>
Sometimes you have to spend a lot of time to make it work.<br>
Hence - this repo.<br>
The aims is to provide a ready-to-run recipes that you can just copy, paste and run.<br>
So, without further ado, here's the current list:
